# GEEKS WHO DRINK FILE FORMATTER!!
Directions for making your life easy:

1) Put files you want to Geek-a-fy into the directory containing the resizer.py file

2) Open the directory in a terminal.

3) Run "python3 resizer.py <YOUR VENUE NAME>"

4) ???

5) Profit!!


WARNINGS!!!
Don't run this twice unless you have the files backed up. I didn't write a safe guard against renaming the same file name twice if you ran my script already. You may write the same name twice if you do this and lose files. I tested on big files so you shouldn't worry about having to do that.

Only tested on Linux. May work on other OS; let me know if it works for you.
